This is a long form description of the mod. You can write whatever you want here

Have some lorem ipsum.

All this time, I never meant you harm
So come what may, it is you I have sworn to protect
So don't take all of the blame, we're all at fault
Ah wait don't take all of the weight, you always do
There will always be something you cannot control
We will set you free, your salvation has begun
No light in sight, it's a world of chaos
But don't lose hope
You are the reason why I still dream
I'll be there, hold on
I'll save you somehow
So where are you now?
I'll reach you by dawn
Before you can be turned
Sweet innocence burned
The fallen angels arrive, let them know
That it's the pain that makes us all human after all
All I see is a dream out of reach
Our fragile precious world
I'll protect it and rise to the call
I don't know if I have lost you yet
Do they control you like a little marionette?
I'll cut the strings if you'd only come with me
Let me free the wings of your soul so you can fly
I've been waiting here, calling to you all this time
Can you feel the wind?
Let me lead you to the sky
No light in sight, it's a world of chaos
But don't lose hope
You are the reason why I still dream
I'll be there, hold on
I'll save you somehow
So where are you now?
I'll reach you by dawn
Before you disappear
The one thing I fear
The fallen angels arrive, let them know
That it's the pain that makes us all human after all
All I see is a dream out of reach
Our fragile precious world
They'll discard it and rise to the call
If you wanna fight with me
Then go ahead, it's destiny
Cause all I wanna do is set you free
You will be the death of me
The power of our army has been cut with a scythe
And if we lose you to them, we may never survive
You can leap but you must first believe
Just one step at a time
So keep your head up, boy and you'll be fine
